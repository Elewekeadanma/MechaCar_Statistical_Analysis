# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
##  Linear Regression to Predict MPG
The spoiler_angle, vehicle_length and AWD provided a non-random amount of vatriance to the mpg values in the dataset.





##  Summary Statistics on Suspension
The variance of the suspension coils in total is 62.29. Therefore, the design specification is met for all manufacturing lots in total.
